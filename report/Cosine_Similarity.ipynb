    "Within the context of this project, cosine similarity is the primary means of determining similarity between two channels, or, more accurately, one and several channels. It offers a high speed calculation with satisfactory results and provides a viable substitution for more computationally intense algorithms such as Alternating Least Squares and Stochastic Gradient Descent. GraphLab has optimized these methods but the data does not take the form of user-item relationship, nor can it expediently convert the data into a structured frame fast enough to not detract from the user experience. As such, cosine similarity seemed the best and most implementable method given a two week time frame."
